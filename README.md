# work-day-scheduler

## Description

This is the challenge for module 5. This application is a work day scheduler for a usual 9 AM - 5 PM shift. It displays the date and current time in the header for the user to see, making this perfect and simple for a busy employee to schedule assigments, tasks, and meetings. The user can plan their day accordingly by writing in the designated time block and saving it to the localStorage. This will make the data still show up even if the application closes or is re-opened later in the day.

## Installation

The user will then write in each time block any task assigned for the day. These change depending on the current time. The grey color represents past tasks, the red color represents the current task, and the green color represents future tasks.
